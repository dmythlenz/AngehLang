Breathe Intelligence into AIAllocator:
  Inhale Requirements -> Analyze:
    - ModelPath: "alloc_predictor.onnx"
    - FeaturePreprocessing:
        ForEach "data_type", "access_pattern":
          Preprocess into "features"

  Exhale AllocationStrategy -> Allocate:
    - Prediction:
        Use ONNXRuntime
        Input: "features"
        Output: Predicted ["size", "alignment", "location"]
    - DecisionMaking:
        Size: Cast to int
        Alignment: PowerOfTwo
        Location: If "location_score" > 0.5 Then "GPU" Else "RAM"

  Implement MemoryMap -> Manage:
    - On Variable "var_name" with Data "data":
        Allocate Memory:
          Address: OS_Alloc(Predicted "size")
          Store: {"address", "size", "alignment", "location"}
